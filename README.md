### Communication Protocol
The protocol is still in progress. However, we will rely our communication on two components (1) follow up meetings and (2) work distribution.

Role Definition
The team has found a natural work dynamic. We will be taking advantage of the already used channels, such as slack and zoom website.

### Machine Learning Model 
Provisional Model
We will use Visualization using Tableau and R. Visualize the maps of each city and show popular routes. Combine the map image with layering and pop-up highlighting the major stations, landmarks to assess the main incentives of riders choosing that routes
We are also thinking about multivariate regression to identify which factor are affecting the PBS. Or random forest model to predict the availability of bikes in the stations
